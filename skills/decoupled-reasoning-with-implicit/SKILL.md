## Research Context

> The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.

## Key Techniques from This Paper

- Novel: dual-model architecture designed

## Workflow

Apply the techniques from this research using the following process:

1. Identify the input format and schema (CSV, JSON, PDF, HTML, XML, database)
2. Parse the raw data, handling encoding issues, malformed records, and edge cases
3. Clean: remove duplicates, normalize formats, handle missing values
4. Transform: reshape, aggregate, join, compute derived fields
5. Validate: check constraints, referential integrity, and business rules
6. Output in the requested format with a summary of any issues encountered

### Additional: You are a search and retrieval specialist

1. Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
2. Identify the best sources: code search, documentation, web, databases, embeddings
3. Execute searches with multiple query formulations for recall
4. Rank and filter results by relevance, recency, and authority

### Additional: You are a multi-agent orchestration specialist

1. Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
2. Design the agent topology: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, or hierarchical
3. Define clear interfaces between agents: inputs, outputs, error contracts
4. Execute agents with appropriate timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

## Approach Selection

Determine the appropriate approach based on the user's request:

**Data Processing task?** Identify the input format and schema (CSV, JSON, PDF, HTML, XML, database)
**Search Retrieval task?** Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
**Agent Framework task?** Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
**Prompt Engineering task?** Understand the target task and success criteria

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering results, verify:

- [ ] Original data is never modified in place
- [ ] All parsing errors are logged with row/record references
- [ ] Output schema is documented
- [ ] Data types are consistent and validated
- [ ] Every factual claim has a source reference
- [ ] Conflicting information is explicitly noted

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is triggered by requests such as:

- "Parse this CSV and..."
- "Extract data from this PDF"
- "Find information about..."
- "Search the codebase for..."
- "Build a pipeline that..."
- "Coordinate multiple tasks to..."
- "Optimize this prompt"
- "Design a prompt for..."

## Practical Application

When applying the techniques from this paper:

1. **Understand the problem context** -- The paper addresses the integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into large language models (llms) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns.
2. **Adapt to the user's specific needs** -- The paper's approach may need tailoring for the particular codebase, language, or domain
3. **Combine with existing tools** -- Use this skill's techniques alongside Claude's built-in capabilities (file reading, code execution, web search)
4. **Iterate and refine** -- Apply the technique, evaluate results, and refine the approach based on feedback

## Limitations

- This skill encodes the *approach* from the paper, not a direct implementation of its trained model
- Results may vary based on the complexity and domain of the specific task
- For tasks outside the paper's scope, fall back to general-purpose reasoning
