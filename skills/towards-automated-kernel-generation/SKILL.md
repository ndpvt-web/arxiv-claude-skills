## Research Context

> The performance of modern AI systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations. Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization. To keep track of this field, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/flagos-ai/awesome-LLM-driven-kernel-generation.

## Key Techniques from This Paper

- Novel: possibilities

## Workflow

Apply the techniques from this research using the following process:

1. Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
2. Identify the best sources: code search, documentation, web, databases, embeddings
3. Execute searches with multiple query formulations for recall
4. Rank and filter results by relevance, recency, and authority
5. Synthesize findings into a structured answer with citations
6. Highlight confidence levels and information gaps

### Additional: You are a multi-agent orchestration specialist

1. Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
2. Design the agent topology: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, or hierarchical
3. Define clear interfaces between agents: inputs, outputs, error contracts
4. Execute agents with appropriate timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

## Approach Selection

Determine the appropriate approach based on the user's request:

**Search Retrieval task?** Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
**Agent Framework task?** Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering results, verify:

- [ ] Every factual claim has a source reference
- [ ] Conflicting information is explicitly noted
- [ ] Results are ranked by relevance, not just recency
- [ ] The answer directly addresses the user's actual question
- [ ] Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Agent failures don't cascade to the whole pipeline

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is triggered by requests such as:

- "Find information about..."
- "Search the codebase for..."
- "Build a pipeline that..."
- "Coordinate multiple tasks to..."

## Practical Application

When applying the techniques from this paper:

1. **Understand the problem context** -- The paper addresses the performance of modern ai systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations.
2. **Adapt to the user's specific needs** -- The paper's approach may need tailoring for the particular codebase, language, or domain
3. **Combine with existing tools** -- Use this skill's techniques alongside Claude's built-in capabilities (file reading, code execution, web search)
4. **Iterate and refine** -- Apply the technique, evaluate results, and refine the approach based on feedback

## Limitations

- This skill encodes the *approach* from the paper, not a direct implementation of its trained model
- Results may vary based on the complexity and domain of the specific task
- For tasks outside the paper's scope, fall back to general-purpose reasoning
