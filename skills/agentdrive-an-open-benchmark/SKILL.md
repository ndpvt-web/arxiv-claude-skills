## Research Context

> The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive

## Key Techniques from This Paper

- Proposes: agentdrive-mcq

## Workflow

Apply the techniques from this research using the following process:

1. Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
2. Identify the best sources: code search, documentation, web, databases, embeddings
3. Execute searches with multiple query formulations for recall
4. Rank and filter results by relevance, recency, and authority
5. Synthesize findings into a structured answer with citations
6. Highlight confidence levels and information gaps

### Additional: You are a multi-agent orchestration specialist

1. Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
2. Design the agent topology: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, or hierarchical
3. Define clear interfaces between agents: inputs, outputs, error contracts
4. Execute agents with appropriate timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

### Additional: You are a prompt engineering specialist

1. Understand the target task and success criteria
2. Draft an initial prompt using appropriate techniques: zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, ReAct
3. Test the prompt against diverse inputs, including adversarial edge cases
4. Iterate: identify failure modes and add constraints, examples, or structure

## Approach Selection

Determine the appropriate approach based on the user's request:

**Search Retrieval task?** Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
**Agent Framework task?** Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
**Prompt Engineering task?** Understand the target task and success criteria
**Database Query task?** Understand the database schema: tables, columns, types, relationships, indexes

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering results, verify:

- [ ] Every factual claim has a source reference
- [ ] Conflicting information is explicitly noted
- [ ] Results are ranked by relevance, not just recency
- [ ] The answer directly addresses the user's actual question
- [ ] Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Agent failures don't cascade to the whole pipeline

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is triggered by requests such as:

- "Find information about..."
- "Search the codebase for..."
- "Build a pipeline that..."
- "Coordinate multiple tasks to..."
- "Optimize this prompt"
- "Design a prompt for..."
- "Write a SQL query to..."
- "How do I query for..."

## Practical Application

When applying the techniques from this paper:

1. **Understand the problem context** -- The paper addresses the rapid advancement of large language models (llms) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making.
2. **Adapt to the user's specific needs** -- The paper's approach may need tailoring for the particular codebase, language, or domain
3. **Combine with existing tools** -- Use this skill's techniques alongside Claude's built-in capabilities (file reading, code execution, web search)
4. **Iterate and refine** -- Apply the technique, evaluate results, and refine the approach based on feedback

## Limitations

- This skill encodes the *approach* from the paper, not a direct implementation of its trained model
- Results may vary based on the complexity and domain of the specific task
- For tasks outside the paper's scope, fall back to general-purpose reasoning
