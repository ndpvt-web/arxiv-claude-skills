## Research Context

> To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines. The experiment videos, code, and dataset are available on our project website: https://comm-cp.github.io.

## Key Techniques from This Paper

- Proposes: an mm-eqa benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions
- Novel: extension of canonical embodied question answering (eqa), where effective communication is crucial
- Novel: llm-based decentralized communication framework designed

## Workflow

Apply the techniques from this research using the following process:

1. Understand the deployment target: cloud provider, container platform, bare metal
2. Design the pipeline stages: build, test, security scan, deploy, verify
3. Generate configuration files: Dockerfile, docker-compose, GitHub Actions, Terraform, K8s manifests
4. Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting for the deployed service
5. Add rollback mechanisms and health checks
6. Document the deployment process and runbook for incidents

### Additional: You are a search and retrieval specialist

1. Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
2. Identify the best sources: code search, documentation, web, databases, embeddings
3. Execute searches with multiple query formulations for recall
4. Rank and filter results by relevance, recency, and authority

### Additional: You are a multi-agent orchestration specialist

1. Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
2. Design the agent topology: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, or hierarchical
3. Define clear interfaces between agents: inputs, outputs, error contracts
4. Execute agents with appropriate timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

## Approach Selection

Determine the appropriate approach based on the user's request:

**Devops Automation task?** Understand the deployment target: cloud provider, container platform, bare metal
**Search Retrieval task?** Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
**Agent Framework task?** Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
**Design Ui task?** Understand the requirements: platform, users, brand guidelines, accessibility needs

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering results, verify:

- [ ] Secrets are managed via vault/env vars, never hardcoded
- [ ] Pipeline has both automated tests and manual approval gates for production
- [ ] Infrastructure changes are version-controlled and reviewable
- [ ] Monitoring covers the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- [ ] Every factual claim has a source reference
- [ ] Conflicting information is explicitly noted

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is triggered by requests such as:

- "Set up CI/CD for..."
- "Create a Dockerfile for..."
- "Find information about..."
- "Search the codebase for..."
- "Build a pipeline that..."
- "Coordinate multiple tasks to..."
- "Build a UI for..."
- "Design a dashboard that..."

## Practical Application

When applying the techniques from this paper:

1. **Understand the problem context** -- The paper addresses to complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects.
2. **Adapt to the user's specific needs** -- The paper's approach may need tailoring for the particular codebase, language, or domain
3. **Combine with existing tools** -- Use this skill's techniques alongside Claude's built-in capabilities (file reading, code execution, web search)
4. **Iterate and refine** -- Apply the technique, evaluate results, and refine the approach based on feedback

## Limitations

- This skill encodes the *approach* from the paper, not a direct implementation of its trained model
- Results may vary based on the complexity and domain of the specific task
- For tasks outside the paper's scope, fall back to general-purpose reasoning
