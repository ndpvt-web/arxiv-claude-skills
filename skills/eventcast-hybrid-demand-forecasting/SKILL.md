## Research Context

> Demand forecasting is a cornerstone of e-commerce operations, directly impacting inventory planning and fulfillment scheduling. However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.

## Workflow

Apply the techniques from this research using the following process:

1. Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
2. Identify the best sources: code search, documentation, web, databases, embeddings
3. Execute searches with multiple query formulations for recall
4. Rank and filter results by relevance, recency, and authority
5. Synthesize findings into a structured answer with citations
6. Highlight confidence levels and information gaps

### Additional: You are a multi-agent orchestration specialist

1. Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
2. Design the agent topology: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, or hierarchical
3. Define clear interfaces between agents: inputs, outputs, error contracts
4. Execute agents with appropriate timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

### Additional: You are a database and SQL specialist

1. Understand the database schema: tables, columns, types, relationships, indexes
2. Translate the user's natural language question into a precise query
3. Optimize the query: use indexes, avoid N+1, minimize data transfer
4. Handle edge cases: NULLs, empty results, ambiguous joins, timezone issues

## Approach Selection

Determine the appropriate approach based on the user's request:

**Search Retrieval task?** Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
**Agent Framework task?** Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
**Database Query task?** Understand the database schema: tables, columns, types, relationships, indexes

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering results, verify:

- [ ] Every factual claim has a source reference
- [ ] Conflicting information is explicitly noted
- [ ] Results are ranked by relevance, not just recency
- [ ] The answer directly addresses the user's actual question
- [ ] Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Agent failures don't cascade to the whole pipeline

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is triggered by requests such as:

- "Find information about..."
- "Search the codebase for..."
- "Build a pipeline that..."
- "Coordinate multiple tasks to..."
- "Write a SQL query to..."
- "How do I query for..."

## Practical Application

When applying the techniques from this paper:

1. **Understand the problem context** -- The paper addresses demand forecasting is a cornerstone of e-commerce operations, directly impacting inventory planning and fulfillment scheduling.
2. **Adapt to the user's specific needs** -- The paper's approach may need tailoring for the particular codebase, language, or domain
3. **Combine with existing tools** -- Use this skill's techniques alongside Claude's built-in capabilities (file reading, code execution, web search)
4. **Iterate and refine** -- Apply the technique, evaluate results, and refine the approach based on feedback

## Limitations

- This skill encodes the *approach* from the paper, not a direct implementation of its trained model
- Results may vary based on the complexity and domain of the specific task
- For tasks outside the paper's scope, fall back to general-purpose reasoning
