## Research Context

> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA.

## Key Techniques from This Paper

- Achieves: state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive llm inference

## Workflow

Apply the techniques from this research using the following process:

1. Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
2. Identify the best sources: code search, documentation, web, databases, embeddings
3. Execute searches with multiple query formulations for recall
4. Rank and filter results by relevance, recency, and authority
5. Synthesize findings into a structured answer with citations
6. Highlight confidence levels and information gaps

### Additional: You are a multi-agent orchestration specialist

1. Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
2. Design the agent topology: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, or hierarchical
3. Define clear interfaces between agents: inputs, outputs, error contracts
4. Execute agents with appropriate timeouts, retries, and fallbacks

### Additional: You are a security analysis specialist

1. Define the scope: code review, configuration audit, threat model, or penetration test
2. Scan for common vulnerability classes: injection, broken auth, misconfig, data exposure
3. Assess each finding: severity (CVSS), exploitability, business impact
4. Recommend specific mitigations with code examples

## Approach Selection

Determine the appropriate approach based on the user's request:

**Search Retrieval task?** Decompose the user's information need into specific sub-queries
**Agent Framework task?** Analyze the task and determine if multi-agent decomposition provides value
**Security task?** Define the scope: code review, configuration audit, threat model, or penetration test

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering results, verify:

- [ ] Every factual claim has a source reference
- [ ] Conflicting information is explicitly noted
- [ ] Results are ranked by relevance, not just recency
- [ ] The answer directly addresses the user's actual question
- [ ] Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Agent failures don't cascade to the whole pipeline

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is triggered by requests such as:

- "Find information about..."
- "Search the codebase for..."
- "Build a pipeline that..."
- "Coordinate multiple tasks to..."
- "Audit this code for security issues"
- "Is this configuration secure?"

## Practical Application

When applying the techniques from this paper:

1. **Understand the problem context** -- The paper addresses recent advances in large language models (llms) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as table question answering (tableqa), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-co...
2. **Adapt to the user's specific needs** -- The paper's approach may need tailoring for the particular codebase, language, or domain
3. **Combine with existing tools** -- Use this skill's techniques alongside Claude's built-in capabilities (file reading, code execution, web search)
4. **Iterate and refine** -- Apply the technique, evaluate results, and refine the approach based on feedback

## Limitations

- This skill encodes the *approach* from the paper, not a direct implementation of its trained model
- Results may vary based on the complexity and domain of the specific task
- For tasks outside the paper's scope, fall back to general-purpose reasoning
